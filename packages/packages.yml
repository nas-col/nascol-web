      description: |
        Graph-tool is an efficient Python module for manipulation and statistical
        analysis of graphs. Contrary to most other Python modules with similar
        functionality, the core data structures and algorithms are implemented in
        C++, making extensive use of template metaprogramming, based heavily on
        the Boost Graph Library. This confers it a level of performance that is
        comparable (both in memory usage and computation time) to that of a pure C/C++ library.

        Simulation and estimation of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)
        for small networks using exact statistics as shown in Vega Yon et al. 
        (2020). As a difference from the 
        'ergm' package, 'ergmito' circumvents using Markov-Chain Maximum 
        Likelihood Estimator (MC-MLE) and instead uses Maximum Likelihood 
        Estimator (MLE) to fit ERGMs for small networks. As exhaustive 
        enumeration is computationally feasible for  small networks, this R 
        package takes advantage of this and provides tools for
        calculating likelihood functions, and other relevant functions, 
        directly, meaning that in many cases both estimation and simulation of 
        ERGMs for small networks can be faster and more accurate than 
        simulation-based algorithms.
